NixOS ran a bit slow for me so I'm sure I missed some configs to make it run smoothly. I think I'll attempt this again when I have more time.

## Hardware specifications

- AMD Ryzen 1600
- Sapphire RX 560
- Asus Phoenix GTX 1050TI
- Samsung EVO 860 512GB
- Samsung EVO 840 120GB
- TODO: Find specific model of WiFi/BT card

## TODO

- [x] Basic bootable NixOS config
- [ ] VFIO config
- [ ] Setup dev environment
- [ ] xmonad
